## Current State
The plugin in its current form can do the following
- Configure/build pact interaction with Avro encoded payload along with matching rules. Works for most of the primitive and complex data types.  
- Verify interaction. Supports only exact match at the moment.

**To do:**

Contributions are welcome! 

- Still some work required to translate the following Pact DSL logical types to appropriate avro format. This can be acheived by using information from avro schema or adding optional config (indicating avro types) for these logical types and updating Matching Rule Definition Grammar (.g4) accordingly. 

| Pact DSL Logical Type       | Avro                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| integer                     | int, long                             |
| decimal                     | float, double, decimal (logical type) |
| number (integer or decimal) | int, long, float, double, decimal     |

- Matching rules path for eachValue $(reference) needs to be fixed. 
- Verify interaction based on Matching Rules. This will be easier to implement if FFI is already available for this.  
- Implement Generators.
